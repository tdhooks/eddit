# Eddit

[Demo video here](https://youtu.be/9nuX9ETmUgA), you will need want to watch in HD.

Eddit is a dirt simple anonymous chat app build with Django and hosted in Docker. To run eddit, first ensure you have docker installed, then run the following command from the root directory:

```
$ source run.sh
```

To stop and remove eddit, use this from the root directory:

```
$ source clean.sh
```

If you have Windows, the shortcut scripts won't work. However, you can peek the scripts and use the commands in them to run eddit if you have docker installed.
